A small password manager with big teeth.

Previously started in Go, Ladon is intended to be a small, lightweight
alternative to paid password managers. The previous (partial) implementation
was scrapped due to Go's lack of suitability for security sensitive
applications (e.g. no way to reliably lock or zero particular memory buffers).
